## Git
Git is a software you use to help you track all the files and its entire history so you don't have to individually keep track of the files. The software tracks the changes you've made on your file. Git is essentially a version control (what I wrote in the first two sentences) software. There are multiple version control software, but Git is one of the popular ones out there. Git also provides you collaboration with other people. You can collaborate with a multitude of people simultaneously. 

## Github
Github is a web service where you can sign up for an account and actually execute the Git software. You can also do other things in Github other than just running Git software. 

## Repo
* Repo aka Repository
* Repository is alternative word for project
* There can be several files within the repository

## Commit
*  Used to save your work
*  Think of this as you are commited to change the file
*  After you make a commit, you can browse your history of all the commits you've made.
*  Every commit has an individual unique id
